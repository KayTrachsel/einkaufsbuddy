# Einkaufsbuddy

## Project Description
The goal of our app is to simplify daily shopping and eliminate the need for annoying paper shopping lists. Each user can create their own shopping lists and customize them based on their interests. In this way, shopping can be planned from home and the problem of losing shopping lists is solved once and for all.

## How to use
After successfully logging in, there are two options: either search for items or view an overview of your own shopping lists. These can then be accessed and managed. Once a list is selected, the included items are displayed and can be edited.
